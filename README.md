## Advanced JavaScript online course I: ES6, object orientation and project standards

## Content

### Prologue: rules, code and maintenance

- Welcome
- Course Considerations
- Project overview
- Page overview
- Manipulating DOM
- If you "wrap" the DOM
- Where are the good practices?

### Specifying a Negotiation

- What is a template?
- The object-oriented paradigm
- OO and Classes
- The Trading class
- Class constructor and parameters
- Beware of the anemic model
- Methods
- Encapsulation
- The syntax get
- Immutable objects
- Defensive programming

### The link between user actions and the model

- The NegotiationController class
- Associating controller methods with user actions
- Transforming document.querySelector into $!
- Changing the context of this with the bind function
- Avoiding traversing the DOM many times
- The problem with dates
- Solving a problem with the functional paradigm
- Spread Operator: Leaving less verbose code
- Arrow Functions: letting the code even less verbose

### Is dealing with date laborious? Call a helper!

- Displaying the Date object in day / month / year format
- Isolating the responsibility of date conversion
- Static Methods
- No more concatenations with Template Strings
- Creating our ListModel

### We got the model, but what about the view?

- Classes representing our Views
- Extracting the Power of Template Strings
- Bolting a rendering system
- Building a Dynamic Template with the map function
- Totalizing the volume in our Template with the reduce function

### Generalizing our View solution

- Repeating code is never good
- Code Inheritance and Reuse
- builder vs. super
